Deciding what food to make is annoying, so I wrote a python script to pick something out for an entire month.

All of the home-cooked meals we like are saved in `meals.txt`, and the script picks out two to make for each week. Ones that we especially like are listed twice, so they potentially could be made more than once in a month, but not two weeks in a row.
